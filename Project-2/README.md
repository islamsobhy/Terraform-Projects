# Project 2: Highly Available & Scalable Web Application Infrastructure (Part 1: Core Networking & Basic EC2 Scaling)

## üìù Project Scenario

You need to build a highly available and scalable web application environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This involves setting up a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), multiple public subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs), and deploying a small cluster of web servers (EC2 instances) within these subnets.

## üåü Core Concepts to Practice

This project is designed to help you master the following advanced Terraform HCL concepts:

* **`count` Meta-Argument:** To create multiple similar resources (e.g., EC2 instances).
* **`for_each` Meta-Argument:** To create resources based on more complex data structures (e.g., specific subnets mapped to AZs).
* **`local` Values:** To define reusable intermediate values that enhance code readability and maintainability.
* **Data Sources:** To fetch dynamic information from AWS (e.g., available Availability Zones).
* **Terraform Functions:** Utilizing built-in functions like `cidrsubnet` for network calculations.
* **Resource Dependencies:** Understanding how Terraform automatically manages the creation order of inter-dependent resources.

## üìã Requirements

### 1. AWS Provider Configuration

* Configure the AWS provider for your chosen region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
* (Keep using your `terraform_dev` profile if you set it up).

### 2. Input Variables (`variables.tf`)

Define the following input variables with appropriate default values:

* `project_name`: A string for tagging resources (e.g., `"MyApp"`).
* `environment`: A string for tagging (e.g., `"Dev"` or `"Staging"`).
* `vpc_cidr_block`: A string for your VPC's CIDR (e.g., `"10.0.0.0/16"`).
* `public_subnet_cidrs`: A **list of strings** representing the CIDR blocks for your public subnets (e.g., `["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]`). Define at least two.
* `instance_type`: A string for the EC2 instance type (e.g., `"t2.micro"`).
* `ami_id`: A string for the AMI ID (use a common Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu LTS AMI for your region, you'll need to find one yourself).
* `instance_count`: A number for how many web server instances to deploy (e.g., `2` or `3`).
* `ssh_access_cidr`: A string for the CIDR block allowed to SSH (e.g., `"0.0.0.0/0"` for simplicity during learning, or your public IP `/32`).

### 3. Local Values (`locals.tf` - Recommended)

Define the following local values:

* `common_tags`: A map containing common tags (`Project` and `Environment`) derived from your `project_name` and `environment` variables. You will apply these tags to most resources.
* `azs`: This local value should fetch the availability zones for your chosen region using a **data source**. This is crucial for distributing subnets.
    * *Hint:* Look for `data "aws_availability_zones"` in Terraform documentation.

### 4. VPC Creation (`main.tf`)

* Create an `aws_vpc` resource using the `vpc_cidr_block` variable.
* Apply your `local.common_tags` to the VPC.

### 5. Internet Gateway (IGW) (`main.tf`)

* Create an `aws_internet_gateway` and attach it to your VPC.
* Apply your `local.common_tags` to the IGW.

### 6. Public Subnets (`main.tf` - using `for_each` or `count`)

* Create `aws_subnet` resources for your public subnets.
* **Challenge:** Use **`for_each`** (preferred for this structure) or **`count`** to iterate through your `var.public_subnet_cidrs` variable.
    * If using `for_each`, map each CIDR from `var.public_subnet_cidrs` to a unique Availability Zone from your `local.azs` list (you'll need to figure out how to assign unique AZs sequentially or based on the map's keys).
    * Ensure `map_public_ip_on_launch` is set to `true`.
    * Apply your `local.common_tags` to each subnet, along with a unique `Name` tag (e.g., `"MyApp-PublicSubnet-us-east-1a"`).

### 7. Public Route Table (`main.tf`)

* Create an `aws_route_table` for your public subnets, associated with your VPC.
* Add a route for `0.0.0.0/0` pointing to your Internet Gateway.
* Apply your `local.common_tags` to the route table.
* Create `aws_route_table_association` resources to associate ***each*** public subnet with this public route table. You'll need to iterate using `for_each` or `count` again based on how you created your subnets.

### 8. Security Group for Web Servers (`main.tf`)

* Create an `aws_security_group` resource.
* Allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from `0.0.0.0/0`.
* Allow inbound SSH (port 22) from your `var.ssh_access_cidr` variable.
* Allow all outbound traffic.
* Associate this security group with your VPC.
* Apply your `local.common_tags` to the security group, plus a descriptive `Name`.

### 9. EC2 Instances (`main.tf` - using `count`)

* Create `aws_instance` resources for your web servers.
* **Challenge:** Use the **`count`** meta-argument with your `var.instance_count` variable.
* Distribute these instances across your public subnets using the `subnet_id` argument. You'll need to figure out how to reference the output of your subnet creation and use an index or modulo operator (`%`) with `count.index` to cycle through available subnets.
* Use the `var.instance_type` and `var.ami_id` variables.
* Associate the web server security group.
* Apply your `local.common_tags` to each instance, along with a unique `Name` tag (e.g., `"MyApp-WebServer-1"`, `"MyApp-WebServer-2"`).

### 10. Outputs (`outputs.tf`)

Define the following outputs:

* `vpc_id`: Output the ID of the created VPC.
* `public_subnet_ids`: Output a **list** of the IDs of all created public subnets.
* `public_instance_ips`: Output a **list** of the public IP addresses of all created EC2 instances.

## üìÅ Recommended File Structure

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ locals.tf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars (for your variable values, keep this out of Git for secrets!)


## üöÄ Important Hints

* **`data "aws_availability_zones"`**: This data source is crucial for dynamically getting AZ names in your region. You can filter the list if you only want a certain number of AZs.
* **`count.index` or `each.key`/`each.value`**: These are essential when iterating with `count` or `for_each` to create unique resources.
* **`aws_subnet.*.id` or `aws_instance.*.public_ip`**: When accessing attributes of resources created with `count` or `for_each`, you'll use `*` (splat expression) to get a list of all their attributes. E.g., `aws_subnet.public.*.id`.
* **`cidrsubnet` function**: Useful for calculating unique CIDR blocks for subnets from a larger VPC CIDR.
